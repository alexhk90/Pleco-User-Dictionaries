Traditional to Simplified Chinese Character Conversion

Used to convert traditional headwords in MoEDict to simplified, but should be more generally applicable.

The Traditional to Simplified conversion was done using information from the SayJack website and information feng posted in this thread (thanks again feng :)).
The information was processed into the three files attached:
Conversion-Always
= simple one-to-one mapping cases (always replace the Traditional with the Simplified for these cases);
Conversion-If
= convert if the Pinyin matches (replace Traditional with Simplified for {Traditional, Pinyin});
Conversion-IfNot
= convert if the Pinyin does not match (replace Traditional with Simplified for {Traditional, !Pinyin}).
