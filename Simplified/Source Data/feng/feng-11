么 么,幺: Taiwan uses 么 for yao1 (a silly thing to do); PRC 么 me5, ma5 (and yao1, 同 “ 幺”) and 幺 yao1. True, I could also look at this from the perspective of the 幺 么,幺 entry above, but I am tempted to delete both entries (a list of ten) because yao1 is Taiwan, 么 and PRC 幺, and Xinhua Zidian has a separate entry for 么 -- these are character form differences, not simplification or official variant character differences; they're one to one. I may just keep 麼：么、麽。Your thoughts are hereby solicited.
