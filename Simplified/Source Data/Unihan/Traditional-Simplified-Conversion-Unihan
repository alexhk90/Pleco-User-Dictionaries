20130831 Conversion-Simp03-Unihan
- Addition of characters from Unihan Traditional-Simplified conversions (kSimplifiedVariant) to previous conversion tables.

0. Obtain data from Unihan.
- Use Unihan_Variants.txt (from http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Unihan.zip).
- Convert characters from Unicode references to actual characters.
- Extract only kSimplifiedVariant entries.
- Resulting file simp.txt.
- Convert to CSV: "sed 's/\t/,/g' simp.txt > simp.csv".
- Clean up resulting CSV file if required (copy/paste to new file "simpA.csv" seemed to be required for some reason).

1. Import Unihan data.
- ".separator ','"
- ".import simpA.csv Unihan"
- select count(*) from Unihan;
3041

2. Manual clean up / additions
- Add 滷=卤:
"insert into Unihan Values('滷','Yiliya','卤');"

3. Remove if already handled in other table.
- Conversion-Always:
select count(*) from Always;
2662
select count(*) from Unihan,Always where Always.Traditional = Unihan.Traditional;
2375
delete from Unihan where exists (select * from Always where Unihan.Traditional = Always.Traditional);
select count(*) from Unihan;
667
- Conversion-If:
select count(*) from AlwaysIf;
5
select count(*) from Unihan,AlwaysIf where AlwaysIf.Traditional = Unihan.Traditional;
3
delete from Unihan where exists (select * from AlwaysIf where Unihan.Traditional = AlwaysIf.Traditional);
select count(*) from Unihan;
664
- Conversion-IfNot:
select count(*) from AlwaysIfNot;
5
select count(*) from Unihan,AlwaysIfNot where AlwaysIfNot.Traditional = Unihan.Traditional;
2
delete from Unihan where exists (select * from AlwaysIfNot where Unihan.Traditional = AlwaysIfNot.Traditional);
select count(*) from Unihan;
662

- Check multi-character conversions in above tables:
select * from Always where Length(Traditional) > 1;
藉口,借口,feng,借口、凭借，otherwise 藉
憑藉,凭借,feng,借口、凭借，otherwise 藉
select * from Unihan where Traditional like '%藉%';
select * from Unihan where Traditional like '%憑%';
select * from Unihan where Traditional like '%藉%';
(no results found so OK)

- Check if any multi-character conversions (i.e. T:S;S) remain in the Unihan tables:
select * from Unihan where Simplified like '%;%';
(no results found so OK)

3. Merge Unihan into Conversion-AlwaysIf table.
select count(*) from Always;
2662
select count(*) from Unihan;
662
- Move all Unihan data into Always:
insert into Always select Unihan.Traditional, Unihan.Simplified, 'Unihan', Unihan.Type from Unihan;
select count(*) from Always;
3324

4. Output as updated conversion tables.
